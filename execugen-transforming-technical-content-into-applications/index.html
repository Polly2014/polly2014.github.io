ExecuGen redefines the traditional "What You See Is What You Get" paradigm by enabling users to obtain functional implementations directly from technical documentation—providing more than what is merely visible on screen. The system consists of a browser extension (ExecuGen Extractor) that extracts content from technical blogs, a code generation component (ExecuGen Core) that understands and translates this content into executable code, and a distributed runtime environment (ExecuGen Runtime) that compiles, executes, and deploys the generated applications. To address performance challenges, we introduce an innovative Docker pool and container preheating mechanism within a Kubernetes cluster architecture. Comprehensive evaluation on 300 technical blog posts and 100 code repositories demonstrates that ExecuGen achieves higher completion rates and faster execution times compared to state-of-the-art systems. By bridging the gap between reading technical content and experiencing functional implementations, ExecuGen represents a significant advancement in intelligent agent systems for software development and technical education.<p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Intelligent Agents, Code Generation, Container Orchestration, Technical Documentation, Software Automation<h2 id=1-introduction>1. Introduction</h2><p>Software developers regularly consult technical blogs to learn about new technologies, algorithms, and programming techniques. However, understanding and implementing concepts from these articles often requires significant manual effort, creating a substantial gap between knowledge acquisition and practical implementation. This disconnect represents a fundamental limitation in how developers interact with technical content—requiring them to tediously translate written explanations into functional code.<p>Traditional approaches to software development involve reading documentation, understanding concepts, and manually implementing solutions. While recent advancements in code generation have improved this workflow, there remains a significant gap between content consumption and code execution. Existing tools often operate in isolation, requiring developers to switch between reading platforms and development environments, disrupting the learning flow and reducing productivity.<p>In this paper, we introduce ExecuGen, an end-to-end agent system that transforms technical blog content into executable applications. ExecuGen provides a seamless bridge between reading about technology and experiencing it firsthand. When browsing technical content, users can activate the ExecuGen Extractor browser extension to analyze the current page, extract relevant technical information, and transmit it to the ExecuGen Core. The Core component generates appropriate code, which is then compiled, executed, and deployed by the ExecuGen Runtime, ultimately providing the user with a functional implementation of the concepts described in the original content.<p>The key contributions of our work include:<ol><li><strong>A novel end-to-end system architecture</strong> that seamlessly bridges technical content consumption and code execution<li><strong>A distributed agent-based design</strong> that separates content extraction, code generation, and execution into loosely coupled components<li><strong>An innovative Docker pool and container preheating mechanism</strong> that significantly improves application startup and execution time<li><strong>A comprehensive evaluation</strong> on diverse datasets demonstrating ExecuGen's effectiveness across various technical domains and content types</ol><p>By transforming "what you see" (technical blog content) into "more than what you get" (functional applications), ExecuGen represents a significant advancement in how developers interact with technical information. We believe this approach has broad implications for technical education, documentation, and software development workflows.<h2 id=2-related-work>2. Related Work</h2><h3 id=2-1-code-generation-from-natural-language>2.1 Code Generation from Natural Language</h3><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled increasingly sophisticated code generation from natural language descriptions. Systems like GitHub Copilot [1] and other code-oriented LLMs have demonstrated impressive capabilities in translating natural language specifications into code snippets. However, these systems typically focus on generating code fragments rather than complete, executable applications.<p>Manus [2] represents a step toward more comprehensive code generation, offering an agent-based approach for creating applications from specifications. While effective for certain use cases, Manus lacks integration with existing technical content and requires users to explicitly formulate requirements. Other research has explored structured approaches to code generation [3, 4], but these typically require specialized inputs rather than working with arbitrary technical content.<h3 id=2-2-browser-extensions-for-developer-productivity>2.2 Browser Extensions for Developer Productivity</h3><p>Browser extensions have become an important component of the modern developer toolset. Extensions like StackOverflow's code snippet integration [5] and GitHub's code navigation tools [6] enhance the browsing experience by providing contextual information and functionality. However, most existing extensions focus on augmenting the reading experience rather than transforming content into executable artifacts.<p>Some research has explored more interactive extensions [7, 8] that provide executable code snippets within documentation. These approaches typically rely on predefined examples rather than dynamically generating code from arbitrary content. ExecuGen builds upon this research by creating a more comprehensive and flexible system for content-to-code transformation.<h3 id=2-3-container-orchestration-and-runtime-environments>2.3 Container Orchestration and Runtime Environments</h3><p>Container orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes [9] have revolutionized application deployment and management. Research in this area has explored automated scaling [10], service mesh architectures [11], and efficient resource allocation [12]. However, few studies have addressed the specific challenges of container management for dynamically generated applications.<p>The concept of container preheating has been explored in different contexts [13, 14], particularly for serverless computing environments. These approaches typically focus on reducing cold-start latency for predetermined function types rather than supporting dynamically generated applications. Our Docker pool and preheating mechanism extends these concepts to support the diverse and unpredictable nature of applications generated from technical content.<h3 id=2-4-end-to-end-agent-systems>2.4 End-to-End Agent Systems</h3><p>Agent-based systems have been applied to various software engineering tasks, including requirements analysis [15], testing [16], and deployment [17]. These systems typically focus on specific phases of the software lifecycle rather than providing an integrated solution across content consumption, code generation, and execution.<p>Recent work on autonomous coding agents [18, 19] has demonstrated the potential for more integrated approaches. However, these systems generally assume a development-focused workflow rather than bridging technical content consumption with code execution. ExecuGen builds upon this research by providing a more comprehensive agent-based solution that spans the entire workflow from content consumption to application execution.<h2 id=3-execugen-system-architecture>3. ExecuGen System Architecture</h2><p>ExecuGen is designed as a distributed, agent-based system that seamlessly transforms technical content into executable applications. The architecture consists of three primary components: ExecuGen Extractor, ExecuGen Core, and ExecuGen Runtime, orchestrated within a Kubernetes cluster environment. Figure 1 provides an overview of the system architecture.<h3 id=3-1-overall-architecture>3.1 Overall Architecture</h3><p>The ExecuGen system follows an agent-based architecture where distinct components collaborate to transform technical content into executable applications. The workflow proceeds as follows:<ol><li>The user activates the ExecuGen Extractor while viewing a technical blog<li>The Extractor analyzes and extracts relevant content, transmitting it to the ExecuGen Core<li>The Core component processes the content, generating appropriate code<li>The ExecuGen Runtime compiles, executes, and deploys the generated code<li>The user receives a URL to access the deployed application</ol><p>This agent-based design allows each component to focus on specific responsibilities while maintaining loose coupling through well-defined interfaces. Communication between components occurs via secure API endpoints, with message queues handling asynchronous processing for improved scalability.<p>The entire system is deployed within a Kubernetes cluster, which provides robust orchestration, scaling, and failure recovery capabilities. The cluster architecture enables efficient resource allocation across components, particularly for the computationally intensive code generation and execution processes.<h3 id=3-2-execugen-extractor>3.2 ExecuGen Extractor</h3><p>The ExecuGen Extractor is implemented as a browser extension compatible with major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge). It consists of three main modules:<ol><li><p><strong>Content Analysis Module</strong>: Identifies and extracts relevant technical content from the current webpage, including code snippets, algorithms, technical descriptions, and contextual information.</p><li><p><strong>Content Transformation Module</strong>: Processes the extracted content into a structured format suitable for transmission to the ExecuGen Core. This includes identifying programming languages, separating code from explanatory text, and preserving important contextual information.</p><li><p><strong>User Interface Module</strong>: Provides an intuitive sidebar interface that allows users to initiate the extraction process, monitor progress, and access the resulting application.</p></ol><p>The Extractor employs several techniques to accurately identify and extract relevant content:<ul><li>DOM traversal and analysis to identify content structure<li>Language detection for code snippets<li>Semantic analysis of surrounding text to establish context<li>Metadata extraction from the webpage</ul><p>After processing, the structured content is securely transmitted to the ExecuGen Core via authenticated API calls.<h3 id=3-3-execugen-core>3.3 ExecuGen Core</h3><p>The ExecuGen Core serves as the central intelligence of the system, transforming extracted content into executable code. It consists of four primary modules:<ol><li><p><strong>Content Understanding Module</strong>: Analyzes the structured content received from the Extractor, identifying key concepts, requirements, and implementation details.</p><li><p><strong>Code Generation Module</strong>: Utilizes advanced language models to generate appropriate code based on the understood content. This module selects appropriate programming languages, frameworks, and libraries based on the content analysis.</p><li><p><strong>Code Verification Module</strong>: Performs static analysis and validation of the generated code to ensure correctness, completeness, and security.</p><li><p><strong>Orchestration Module</strong>: Manages the overall workflow, including communication with the Extractor and Runtime components, handling error conditions, and providing status updates.</p></ol><p>The Core component employs a multi-stage processing pipeline that progressively refines the understanding of the content and the corresponding code generation:<ol><li>Initial content analysis to identify core concepts and requirements<li>Generation of high-level architecture and component design<li>Detailed implementation of individual components<li>Integration of components into a cohesive application<li>Verification and optimization of the generated code</ol><p>This progressive refinement approach helps ensure that the generated application accurately reflects the concepts presented in the original content while maintaining code quality and security.<h3 id=3-4-execugen-runtime>3.4 ExecuGen Runtime</h3><p>The ExecuGen Runtime handles the compilation, execution, and deployment of applications generated by the Core component. It consists of three primary modules:<ol><li><p><strong>Build System</strong>: Compiles and packages the generated code, managing dependencies and build configurations for various programming languages and frameworks.</p><li><p><strong>Execution Environment</strong>: Provides containerized environments for running the compiled applications, ensuring isolation, security, and resource management.</p><li><p><strong>Deployment Manager</strong>: Configures networking, routes, and access control for deployed applications, providing users with accessible URLs.</p></ol><p>The Runtime leverages container technology to provide isolated execution environments for generated applications. Each application is deployed within its own container, with appropriate resource limits and security constraints to ensure safe execution.<h3 id=3-5-resource-scheduling-and-docker-pool>3.5 Resource Scheduling and Docker Pool</h3><p>A key innovation in ExecuGen is our Docker pool and container preheating mechanism, which significantly improves application startup and execution time. Traditional container-based approaches suffer from cold start issues, where container initialization introduces significant latency. Our approach addresses this challenge through several techniques:<ol><li><p><strong>Docker Pool Management</strong>: We maintain a pool of pre-initialized container images for common runtime environments (Python, JavaScript, Java, etc.). These base images include frequently used libraries and frameworks, reducing initialization time.</p><li><p><strong>Container Preheating</strong>: Based on content analysis in the early stages of processing, we predict the likely runtime requirements and proactively initialize appropriate containers from the pool. This preheating occurs concurrently with code generation, ensuring that a suitable environment is ready when code execution is required.</p><li><p><strong>Resource Prediction</strong>: We employ machine learning techniques to predict the resource requirements (CPU, memory, disk) for generated applications based on content characteristics. This enables more efficient resource allocation and container placement within the Kubernetes cluster.</p><li><p><strong>Adaptive Scaling</strong>: The system continuously monitors resource utilization and adjusts the size and composition of the Docker pool based on observed usage patterns. This ensures efficient resource utilization while maintaining responsive performance.</p></ol><p>Figure 2 illustrates the Docker pool and preheating mechanism, highlighting how containers are managed throughout the application lifecycle.<h2 id=4-implementation>4. Implementation</h2><p>This section describes the implementation details of the ExecuGen system, focusing on key algorithms, optimization techniques, and integration approaches.<h3 id=4-1-content-extraction-and-understanding>4.1 Content Extraction and Understanding</h3><p>The content extraction process involves several steps to accurately identify and process technical content from blog posts:<ol><li><p><strong>DOM Analysis</strong>: The Extractor employs a hierarchical DOM traversal algorithm to identify content sections, distinguishing between explanatory text, code snippets, images, and other elements. This analysis considers HTML structure, class names, and common patterns used in technical blogs.</p><li><p><strong>Code Identification</strong>: Code snippets are identified through a combination of HTML markup (e.g., <code>&LTpre></code>, <code>&LTcode></code> tags), syntax highlighting elements, and text pattern analysis. For unmarked code, we employ a language identification model that achieves 94% accuracy across 15 common programming languages.</p><li><p><strong>Context Association</strong>: To maintain relationships between explanatory text and code snippets, we implement a proximity-based association algorithm that links related content elements. This contextual information is critical for accurate code generation, as it provides intent and explanation for code fragments.</p><li><p><strong>Knowledge Graph Construction</strong>: The extracted content is organized into a knowledge graph that represents concepts, relationships, and implementation details. This structured representation facilitates more accurate code generation by providing a coherent view of the technical concepts.</p></ol><p>The content understanding algorithm employs a multi-pass approach:<pre class=language-python data-lang=python style=background:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span style=color:#b48ead>def </span><span style=color:#8fa1b3>analyze_content</span><span>(</span><span style=color:#bf616a>extracted_content</span><span>):

This improvement is particularly pronounced for complex applications, where preheating provides up to 86% reduction in deployment time.<p>Resource utilization measurements showed that the Docker pool consumes approximately 18% additional cluster resources during idle periods, but this overhead is justified by the significant performance improvements during active use.<h3 id=5-4-comparison-with-existing-systems>5.4 Comparison with Existing Systems</h3><p>We compared ExecuGen with two state-of-the-art systems:<ol><li><strong>Manus</strong>: A popular agent-based code generation system<li><strong>A popular open-source code generation framework</strong> (which we'll refer to as Framework-X)</ol><p>Table 2 presents the comparative results across key metrics.<table><thead><tr><th>Metric<th>ExecuGen<th>Manus<th>Framework-X<tbody><tr><td>Completion Rate<td>86%<td>74%<td>69%<tr><td>Avg.

Table 3 presents the results for three different model configurations.<table><thead><tr><th>Model Configuration<th>Completion Rate<th>Functional Correctness<th>Avg.

The medium configuration provides an attractive balance between performance and cost, achieving 84% completion rate at less than half the cost of the large configuration.<p>Our analysis suggests that domain-specific fine-tuning of smaller models may be a more cost-effective approach than simply using larger general-purpose models. This represents an important direction for future work.<h2 id=6-discussion-and-future-work>6.

Conclusion</h2><p>In this paper, we presented ExecuGen, an end-to-end agent system that transforms technical blog content into executable applications. By bridging the gap between technical documentation and functional implementation, ExecuGen redefines the traditional "What You See Is What You Get" paradigm—providing users with more than what they initially see.<p>Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrated ExecuGen's effectiveness across diverse technical domains, achieving an 86% completion rate and 81% functional correctness score on a dataset of 300 technical blog posts. The system's innovative Docker pool and container preheating mechanism significantly improves performance, reducing application deployment time by 72% compared to standard approaches.<p>ExecuGen represents a significant advancement in how developers interact with technical content, transforming passive reading into active experimentation and learning. While limitations remain, the system demonstrates the potential for agent-based approaches to bridge the gap between documentation and implementation, enhancing both technical education and developer productivity.<p>As the line between natural language and code continues to blur, systems like ExecuGen point toward a future where the boundary between reading about technology and implementing it becomes increasingly seamless—a future where what you get is indeed much more than what you see.<h2 id=references>References</h2><p>[1] Chen, M., Tworek, J., Jun, H., et al.
