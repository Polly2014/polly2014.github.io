init命令来创建一个新的Zola项目。\n\n编写你的第一篇博文\n在你的Zola项目中，你可以在content目录下创建一个新的Markdown文件来编写你的第一篇博文。\n\n构建和预览你的网站\n最后，你可以使用zola serve命令来构建和预览你的网站。\n\n现在，你可以在你的浏览器中打开http://localhost:1111来查看你的网站。\n借助GPT，你可以更快速、更高效地搭建你的Zola个人博客。希望你喜欢这篇文章！\n","id":"https://polly2014.github.io/how-to-build-blog-with-zola/","title":"如何借助GPT搭建Zola个人博客"},"https://polly2014.github.io/openhands-deployment-guidance/":{"body":"前言\n在现代软件开发中，自动化和智能化工具的使用变得越来越重要。OpenHands 是一个强大的工具，可以帮助开发者快速部署和管理项目。本指南将详细介绍如何在 Azure 上部署 OpenHands，包括安装 Docker 和 Docker Compose，配置 Azure 的 GPT-4 API 接口，并将服务映射到外网的 80 端口。\n\n步骤 1: 在 Azure 上创建虚拟机\n\n登录 Azure 门户。\n创建一个新的虚拟机，选择以下配置：\n\n操作系统: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS\n大小: 至少 2 核 CPU 和 4GB 内存\n网络: 确保启用了 HTTP 和 HTTPS 端口。\n\n\n启动虚拟机并通过 SSH 连接到它。\n\n\n步骤 2: 安装 Docker 和 Docker Compose\n在虚拟机中运行以下命令以安装 Docker 和 Docker Compose：\n\n安装 Docker\n\n\n\n安装 Docker Compose\n\n\n\n验证安装：\n\n\n步骤 3: 部署 OpenHands\n\n克隆 OpenHands 的代码仓库：\n\n\n\n创建一个 .env 文件以配置环境变量：\n\n\n\n使用 Docker Compose 启动服务：\n\n\n步骤 4: 配置 Azure 的 GPT-4 API 接口\n\n登录 Azure 门户。\n创建一个新的 OpenAI 服务。\n获取 API 密钥和终端点。\n将 API 密钥添加到 .env 文件中：\n\n\n\n重启服务以应用更改：\n\n\n步骤 5: 将服务映射到外网的 80 端口\n\n编辑 docker-compose.yml 文件，将服务的端口映射到 80：\n\n\n\n重启服务：\n\n\n\n确保 Azure 网络安全组 (NSG) 中允许 HTTP (80) 流量。\n\n结语\n通过以上步骤，您已经成功在 Azure 上部署了 OpenHands，并配置了 GPT-4 API 接口。现在，您可以通过外网访问您的服务，并充分利用 OpenHands 的强大功能来提升开发效率。\n","id":"https://polly2014.github.io/openhands-deployment-guidance/","title":"程序员瑞士军刀之OpenHands部署指南"},"https://polly2014.github.io/publication/":{"body":"","id":"https://polly2014.github.io/publication/","title":"Research
